# Chapter 01: 

Arrival on Faceless Haven and Meeting with Jesse and her crew from the Orphans of the Seas.

- I got chained and disrespectfully dragged to a Viking camp
    
- On the way to Castle Lochtwain. 1-2d NW from Viking camp. 
    
- Jumped by a Mindflayer assassin (former enslavers of Korin), dispatched but strong opponent.
    
- Reason was some cross betrayal. Korin betrayed the Mindflayers (how to betray enslavers ? Need trust to betray. Investigate this more). The Prime (Frost Rider male) betrayed Korin (right?) to try and kill Korin for the Mindflayers (of the Void Seeker ship). 
    
- The trap was set up using an enchanted boombox which repeatedly shouted the same message. Interesting small piece of deception. On its side lied the body of Lisa, whom I returned to life after the battle. She’s now the first zombie I create on this island. I am quite proud of that one, the skull is open and looks like a bowl with a body and legs. 
    
- Exploration of the underground compounds, apparently the others already went there but were surprised by stuff we found. 
    
- UG1: frostrider corpses (2)
    
- UG2: some Gundamn contraption  in which the fish climbed and used in order to  simulate her walking
    
- UG3: 
    
	- Collected 3 Eldritch crystals in a glass bottle filled with an acidic fluid in which the crystals were originally floating (need to investigate these)
    
	- ToDo: Transcribe Divination in the Book of Secrets & buy incense (box opened by Alunz)
    
	- The Elf got herself a nice magical ring of spell storing (which I identified for her) 
    
- UG4: Imprisoned dwarves (2), one of them stoned (now dead but gave me, in he’s postmortem peace, a lead to find the password of the UG10 access via Lift), the other quite old and currently similarly dead from the poisoned gas liberated in the lift (the dumbass didn’t even use the gas masks of the looted frostriders from UG1). Both small creatures where apparently working for someone named Schneeflitzen (or something like that)
    
- Currently back in the Underground 3, the tubes placed there, one holds a (dead) ex work friend from Korrin on the Void Seeker (the ship where they were enslaved) . Not sure what their relationship really was. Nevemind, I don’t have enough spell slots remaining at the moment to spend another one on vain curiosity.  
    Korrin and I found out what the coded message actually meant! How to form the password! What a feat, that’ll show them not to underestimate me.  
    “Blut macht uns stark  
    Kill the Verrater  
    More Brains”  
    — Then, once the weird Mindflayer language got dispeled, we got instead  
    1 1  
    2 2  
    3 2  
    → Blood The Brains  
    Which ended up with us not needing to bring in a Vampire to solve the riddle, which was ok too. 
    
- Now we should test that password I think!
