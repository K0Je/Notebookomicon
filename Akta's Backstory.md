# The Templelab & The Calamity
1. Born from unknown (to me) Tiefling parents
2. lived in an isolated clan of Tieflings, grew up with my grandmother and my siblings. Our grandmother taught us to be proud of our horns and of our Bloodline. 
   The whole village wasn’t much to look at, but our clan was 20ish Tielflings strong united, true and lived a decent life. 
3. from a very young age, I was thought the secrets of the necromancers as I showed affinity for these energies and a keen intellect to understand the scriptures about how our Arts were able to cure the most prevalent disease of all, Death and how we could further our Arts in manipulating the state of other creatures (poison, necrosis, fatigue, blindness, ...).

4. With time, between these scriptures and the inscriptions on the walls and ceilings of The Templelab, I deduced that there was a much more efficient way to establish control over illnesses and harm than the research and experiments conducted by my fellow Adepts of the Undying. There seems to have elements pointing to the existence of a “new” type of creature, chimeric in nature, born from the incantations of a Warlock of great power in times long forgotten. The clues, hidden across the gigantic throve of lore which was ours to keep, preserve and transmit to the next generations, clearly implied that the creature was made of the corpses of at least 2 other creatures of different races. 
5. That is when I realized that the denial of the other Necro-Researchers was actually fear of the power borne from such knowledge. They dare not pursue the investigation of what they pretend is an impossible legend, but that is because they can't see the signs like I do! 
6. It matters not, I will do it, I will recover that knowledge and bring it back to my peers, my clan and my family. That is my resolve.
  
7. Taking care of the relics revered in The Templelab, I was assigned to the reverence of the most powerful one, “Ophidia”, also known as “The Arm of Erebus”. It was wielded by Erebus himself, our forefather to all, in times of legends. It is the very symbol of our clan!
8. I spent countless hours meditating with the spirits of this ancient artifact. Soothing its moods and longings. I always feel attracted to the weapon and wondered what foes it teared down during it's epic adventures. I dreamed about wielding it and felling the enemies of my races, punishing the filthy humans who persecute the Tieflings living among them. But who knows how's going to be deemed worthy of wielding our most precious heritage? That, our elders haven't decided yet, and haven't been able to do for as long as I can remember. 
9. In the meantime, I also spent countless hours training for combat using a whip (not Ophidia, mind you, just a 0815 whip of course), as is required from the caretaker of Ophidia, who is expected to exhibit mastery in combat with such weapons during the Equinox Festivals held by our clan. I can't say I was a master at the time, but I sure as the 7th Hell could hold my own against experienced combatants.

10. One day, I decided to show my siblings how far my research had brought me. I was proud of the rituals I had deducted and, where necessary, complemented the missing parts using my own knowledge. Additionally, the process required several voices to chant simultaneously at 2 moments, and I really couldn't ask anyone else. I thought that it was finally time for an experiment. 
11. We went into The Templelab main Hall, bringing with us samples of several creatures I had previously cautiously selected and stored. 
12. During the Ritual, everything went according to my prediction, up to the point where the Altar of the Undying suddenly burst with a wave of energy so powerful that it knocked us down and temporarily burned all our senses with a type of biting harsh cold impossible to describe.
13. The remains I brought remained inanimate, but the other test subjects, animals and dead Tieflings alike, woke up. Chaos ensued. Like the mindless wrath of a flood, the undead creatures, appearing from every corner of the temple, started killing everything in their path. Now, in my fall I must have knocked down the pedestal holding Ophidia because it lay under my hand when I tried to stand back up. I fought back as well as I could the creatures attacking me, The Arm of Erebus being the only response I had to offer to my assailants. I could nearly feel the might Our Father Erebus must have felt while wielding such a beautiful and powerful weapon. His spirits must have aided me, otherwise I couldn't explain how I managed to fend off the relentless Returned for so long. The swarm army from beyond was already spilling out of The Templelab like fresh guts from slaughtered cattle. I could hear the people outside scream in horror while the teeth and claws shredded their flesh. Impaired by the flow of undead, I could only witness how my brother, now a living dead too, threw our sister to the ground and started tearing her apart. 
14. ***Field Notes***:
    Considering my post-mortem observations on the advancement of the necrotic Phthisis on his body, my current theory is that the strain of the spell was too much for our dear brother, who never showed strong signs of synergy with the powers of our patron. The spell must have consumed parts of his vitality in order to imbue that energy to the spell. Him being the weakest magical user participating, I propose that his resistance was equally the weakest and therefore, the spell disproportionately drew his life force over the one of my sister and me, dramatically forcing the rapid necrosis of his tissues and organs. 
    ***End of Field Notes***

15. Feelings I still can't fully describe then took possession of my psyche and I went on a rampage, using every spell and every object I encountered to smith the undead back to their previous inanimate state. When the Dance of the Dead was finally over and the carnage fell quiet, I was the only member of my clan still standing (alive, some were still upright, but dead. These ones, I dispatched swiftly before leaving, so that I wouldn't have to worry about them during the coming nights in the woods). They were now all dead, all because the ritual failed to work as intended. All because I didn't have access to sufficient lore to enact my theory. And likely too because my brother proved too weak. But something worked, deads raised and that was a very exciting outcome for my research! 
16. That day I lost everyone I ever knew, and knew I couldn't stay alone here. I had already learned what I could from our archives and from the elders of the clan. I had to understand everything about Necromancy and redo the rites in order to someday succeed. The future of the plane is in my hands alone now. What a heavy responsibility to bear. But I will not falter! My clan did not die in vain, as long as our will and knowledge lives in me as I pursue our ultimate goal and vanquish Death itself. In the Name of Erebus, our ancestor who lent me his strength in combat and hardship, I will honor our clan and heritage. Varkolak reminds me of my vow and goal every time the bones, teeth, fangs, and horns of my family run across my skin.

# Shadowfell and The Shrine
17. Various travels to acquire experience and knowledge, including in the wielding of a Whip.
18. Maybe always influence of azrael on me, guiding me towards Shadowfell and the release of my ancestral weapon. 
19. Travel to Shadowfell, via a temporary, naturally occurring, Bleak Path,  looking for necrotic energy sources. The shadow crossing opened under the right conditions, which where unknown to me, I just happened to be investigating at the right time of the year and of the night (light closing shadow crossing). Avoiding some of the most belligerent  umbrimals (shadow creatures) was necessary. Many types of interesting Undead to study (Shadows, various kinds of Nightshades, ) but most interestingly, Netherese Shades, humanoids who transformed into Shades in order to gain the powers of immortality, regeneration, and agelessness.
20. Or visit to the Fane of Shadows, aka Umbral Shrine, a sanctuary that journeyed through time and worlds it only materialized during a certain date at midnight, and stayed only temporarily in each world for a short time.  The temple of Shar that shifted in and out of the Prime Material plane. That time, at a necromantic focus. 
21. ( Shadow traded for my Shadow Touch Feat more visible among mortals for this feature; of familiar plays my shadow in the daily life),

22. Encountering Azrael and going on the Puphuros’s Quest; Forge God, essence brought to him (gramps (alzun+trebor) Hondo’s weapon forged together). 
    No story constraints (ideally several Questions to solve or Moral Quality test, evtl. Combat? Or not? ) 

# Purphoros & The Ancestors
22. Coming from a small cold island (near Tropical Island), where Purphoros, a Leonins who had reached goodhood as the God of the Forge, wielding Akmon, his Hammer, was awaiting, unbeknownst to me.
23. The first challenge consisted in slaying figures coming out of the lava (2, female + mql4), I had to slay them, just for PP once thesy became aggreice (but how should I have know. 
24. 1 is my broo nahl, one is my ex? One turn to stonge when they toucheed. The other remained of of magma. The rest was like the rulebook once they became clearly aggrersive, I fought back and vainquised them

25. Purphoros threw Ophidia in front of him only for it to land in the bubbling molten lava lac. I couldn’t let our ancestral weapon be lost to whims of another creature, be it a god or not. As a Tiefling I know that I can resist fire and scorching heat better than any other creature, but lava, fresh, glowing and bubbling molten lava at that, that’s on another level, I didn’t knew if my constitution could take it. I nevertheless jumped, hands first, into the steaming lake of melted stone and tried to reach for Ophidia. Of course, not being the most athletic among my kin, I couldn’t quite reach the whip and fell in the burning lava. My skin began to blister and my senses went mad with sudden and overwhelming pain. I continued to try and swim, if moving inside a pool of lava counts as swimming in an attempt to save my most precious possession but it was too far. In excruciating pain, my senses went numb.    
26. I woke up trashing on the basalt floor where I stood moments before, still agonizing from the pains my mind seemed to remember. Was this all an illusion, or was it maybe that the god of the forge shielded my body while leaving my senses bare or was it a magically conjured fluid taking the appearance of magma and inflicting the pain without the damage? I might never know.
27. Purphoros was still seating upon his throne, watching me with his calm and impenetrable gaze. His rumbling voice boomed in the cavern, Purphoros asked me to lie my life in front of his judgement, by which he was instructing me to tell him the tale of my life and my travels. Purphoros wanted me to the reasons of my arrival in his den, to flesh our my motivations.
28. Tell my life’s story, while his Hammer, Akmon, floating some short distance away from us, on my left-hand side, approaches or receded from an anvil in a motion like a hammering of the anvil on which Ohpidia stood straight, in a staff-like posture , pommel on the shiny surface of the obsidian anvil, thong erect vertically while the fall and cracker slithered around the rest of the whip in a strange motions and patterns. Treateniang to shatter it, back in time + splinters + throbbing left hand on omission —> rewind

29. Upon releasing the essences of my ancestor from their slumber, he warned me that the weapon has it’s own tast and that such weapons are bound to react to the actions of their owner. He explained that pleasing the spirits of my ancestors with acts of bravery would make them keen to support me during my upcoming challenges, while angering them through acts of cowardice would bring upon me their disdain and tempt them with leaving me and the weapon.  

30. I was bearly reaching the shore as the earth stared trembling. Fruits fell from the surrounding trees and animals scattered to find safety. Something told me that this wasn’t another but Purphoros leaving its temporary temple, letting the volcan enter in eruption. I left quickly and took the sea while torrents of lava where already hugging the face of the now fully active volcano.  

31. This is common knowlege and I am no fool, quasit are decivers. 
32. Followed me, even actually helped me, incl in Shadowfell and told me about the unlocked potemtioal of the weapon and wjere to find the leonin. 
33. Coming from a small cold island (near Tropical Island), ent on a quest. where Purphoros (Leonins who reached goodhood as the God of the Forge, wielding Akmon, his Hammer)
  
34. Went cause I needed a way the leave isle, turmed out one the clans on the island was a people of fishers. 
    
35. Purphoros 1st Test: 
36. Purphoros threw Ophidia in front of him only for it to land in the bubbling molten lava lac. I couldn’t let our ancestral weapon be lost to whims of another creature, be it a god or not. As a Tiefling I know that I can resist fire and scorching heat better than any other creature, but lava, fres, glowing and bubbling molten lava at that, that’s on another level, I didn’t knew if my constitution could take it. We knew full well that Tieflings weren't invulnerable to heat and flames but my clan prided itself to be of the most resistant specimens of our race. I nevertheless jumped, hands first, into the steaming lake of meled stone and tried to reach for Ophidia. Of course, not being the most athletic among my kin, I couldn’t quite reach the whip and fell in the burning lava. My skin began to blister and my senses went mad with sudden and overwhelming pain. I continued to try and swim, if moving inside a pool of lava counts as swimming in an attempt to save my most precious possession but it was too far. In excruciating pain, my senses went dumb. 
37. I woke up trashing on the basalt floor where I stood moments before, still agonizing from the pains my mind seemed to remember. Was is an illusion, or was it maybe that the god of the forge shielded my body while leaving my senses bare or was it a magically conjured fluid taking the appearance of magma and inflicting the pain without the damage? I might never know. 
38. Purphoros was still seating upon his throne, watching me with his calm and impenetrable gaze.
  
39. Purphoros 3 Test → sotry of life, Test 1 is combat vs golems.

40. Upon releasing the essences of my ancestor from their slumber, he warned me that the weapon has it’s own tast and that such weapons are bound to react to the actions of their owner. He explained that pleasing the spirits of my ancestors with acts of bravery would make them keen to support me during my upcoming challenges, while angering them through acts of cowardice would bring upon me their disdain and tempt them with leaving me and the weapon. 
41. I was bearly reaching the shore as the earth stared trembling. Fruits fell from the surrounding trees and animals scattered to find safety. Something told me that this wasn’t another but Purphoros leaving its temporary temple, letting the volcan enter in eruption. I left quickly and took the sea while torrents of lava where already hugging the face of the now fully active volcano.  Village destroyeD? Already abandoned? 

Update “motivations” too when done

- Common is not my first language, thought from Grossi (said it could be useful someday because lot of lore is written in common), reading fine, oracle can be imperfect

# Present Days

44. The recent expedition leading me from Rising Sun, the local hub town, to Faceless Haven, which I mentioned earlier already.
45. The rest is history.
