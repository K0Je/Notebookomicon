Akta did not fully understand the ties coming with her meddling with the beings originating from Shadowfell at the time.  
But people of her craft are walking that thin line. A thin line between power and damnation, threaded in order to assert control over magic beyond imagination. That is their calling, dancing a dance of charm and dexterity with immense power. This arm wrestling of mind and matter, they engage in all to take the lead and ascend to mastery or misstep, and fall into an eternity of death. Or worse, a living eternity falling in the arms of the powers their tried to reign. 

Should Akta ever die, depending on the circumstances of her passing, her motivation will change, coming back has a wrathful, vengeful, betrayed, traumatized, lost, forgetful mirror / rest of herself is an option. 

(Under the right circumstances, like a failed reanimation (maybe even going mad and trying to reanimate Ba'al ?) or smthg else flavorfully related, Ba’al is revived as a Death’s Domain Cleric, without teeth and some missing bones (hence virtually mute as can’t properly articulate and is mostly unintelligible, req. Comprehend languages as a ritual & telepathy (self, via Feat) to communicate easily; only use of the spell as Comp languages used on others around himself when he wants to express himself), since they’re on Varkolak OR Varkolak disappears as it’s the source which carried Ba’al’s Essence for its resurrection (returns as a cleric of the death domain for flavor, grave only for the name, twilight for flavor+efficiency, convinced his prayers brought him back)). His ultimate goal being willingly and knowingly (or neither) to destroy / combat his sister's work and goal (i.e. annihilate any chance of a Necro Chimera Spell to be crafted, removing books and scriptures from existence)

Still wielding Ophidia, but as Squamata, the Caduceus “Bankai” form of the weapon (specs mod req.)

Transferred (very cinematically with shadow tendrils etc.) to Shadowfell, because of the link that developed when she was shadow touched.

There, she’ll undergo a transformation (side quest?) into an undead, shadow focused character.

Warlock, pact with the Undead, focus on shadow/ghostly traits and skills, using the pact of the weapon to make the whip the main combat damage action, using dexterity (as it's a finesse Weapon). 

Req. Reselection of spells and feats and ability scores (dext, char >...> strength). Char still physically weak, depending on events previous to death, could become “mindless” and vengeful. Not interested in studying anymore but enact a vengeance or other higher goal, potentially becoming dumb or zealous in the process. 

  
See draft Build in DnDBeyond
Based on DEXT and armed combat with the whip (finess weapon), spell combat support, no more necromacy, Shadow supported and affecting. Stealth levitation invisibility. Pact with the Undead (Akta herself is now an undead undead), pact of the weapon. 

No need for books and knowldge, Akta has a new pressing goal to achieve and no time to lose to get it done.
Could also be w. Pact of the chain instead if we go the route of the Quasit linked backstory 

*Reborn through hexblade or undead depending on situation and backstory progress Shadow Mage*

Shadow Touched Feat
Warlock only has max lvl spell slots, hence never get to cast a 2nd time at level 1 with this Feat. 
False Life 
Hit Die =1d8+2 (3-10), false life = 1d4+4 (5-8) 
The feature gives me a single “extra-but-temporary” hit dice.
flavor: coming back from a quest there with the Feat instead of the seeked after immortality and regeneration.
- Cause Fear (CC, 60ft, 1trg + 1trgt slot)
been contaminated by Shadow energies and became closer to the Shadow Realm inhabitants. 
 - Ray of Sickness (60ft, 2d8 +1d8 slot; poisoned)
- False Life (self, 1d4+4 & +5 slot HP, 1h))

War Weapon Master Warlock - Combat Dexterity
Lucky 
Mobile 
Poisoner
Observant/Resilient
Gift of the Metallic Dragon
 

Reworks of the Weapon would accordingly be necessary. Reforging? 
- caducea-Scickle with bat-demon wings deco, named “Squamata” when solidified and otherwise remains Ophidia the whip.
- to play the Pact of the Blade part, switch only between both of these weapons). Ophidia could remain the Spellcasting pendant of the weapon while Squamata becomes the Blade for armed close combat
- with a single set of upgrades or two separate but smaller ones (12 SP each?) , two types of damages and stats
- Could restrict to 1x switch / day (or long rest, but using the night to switch the weapon in the shadows sounds nice)
   
*Mixed Tiefling bloodlines plot? Or property replacement?*
