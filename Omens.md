There is no peace and comfort more complete than that of the inky embrace of the dark. The absence of light is comforting, empowering and helps you reach your full potential. You gain 120 feet of darkvision. If you already have darkvision, its range is extended by 60 feet. In either case, your darkvision applies to magical and nonmagical darkness. You move through the night as if you were one and the same. You make all Dexterity (Stealth) checks at advantage when you are in dimly lit or dark areas.

You can also create a shroud of impenetrable murk. Once per short rest, you can cast darkness without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. As long as you are in the spell's area of effect, any creature that targets you with a melee attack must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the dark for one minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each turn to end the effect early. The DC for this effect is your spellcasting DC or 12 + your proficiency bonus, whichever is higher.

SCALING DOWN

Until level 10, eliminate the ability to frighten opponents within your darkness spell. All other benefits still apply.

SIDE QUESTS

1. The prosperous city of Dirgate has become shrouded in unnatural darkness. An adult black dragon with the power to wield shadows as weapons has made the city its new home, turning citizens into shadows that serve him. Only defeating the dragon will restore light and safety to the city, also granting you the Child of Darkness boon.

2. A deity of night appears to you in a dream, requesting your aid. Their champion, the Midnight Cavalier, was taken captive and is surrounded by a blinding light that blocks the deity's sight. Free the cavalier and you will receive the Child of Darkness boon in thanks.
