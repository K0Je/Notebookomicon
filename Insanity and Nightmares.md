There are several reasons why I don’t sleep.

First off, it’s a waste of time when I can use these hours to study, train or do various useful activities. 

Also, there are the nightmares. Even when crossing the wilderness alone, I felt followed, like the nightmares would stick to me, attracted by my scent, hunting me through the deserts, the oceans and through time, like Shadowhounds would track a prey. Like Shadowhounds, latching at the first sign of faltering, bitting my mind, invading my soul with their shadowy tendrils, tearing my sanity apart, and shattering peace with chaotic and indomitable fury.

So, no, no thanks, I am definitely better off not sleeping.

# Insanity at the Mind flayer’s Lair

My recent encounter with a Mind flayer sniper proved more taxing than I would have expected. These aberrations prey on the mind (hence their name, probably). Their repeated attacks inflicted pain and hurt, taxing my vitality. Vitality which I luckily could recover after their attacks. But it didn’t stop there. These vile and fascinating creatures triggered thoughts in me, forced images and feeling I thought I had finally managed to escape to come back, as vivid as ever, and strike me again with mercilessly. I felt like I would drown, I felt like I could never extinguish these Shadows from my subconscious. Because I know the images were mine, there was nothing new in these waken dreams, always the same patterns as ever, repeated once more, stronger than ever.

They made me live this, while I was awake. They tortured me willingly and without second thought nor reason. I’ll kill the next ones I encounter before they even get a chance to use any of their abilities. And then I’ll study them. Extensively. Maybe I’ll keep some as dismembered and incapacitated living specimens. That’d only be fair. Obviously, them being non-humanoid adds a complexity level to my research. It might indeed prove excessively complex to fuse them with humanoids. But at the same, because of that very quality, they could bring me answers or even solutions to the limitations of my current implementation of the Chimera spell. 

  
- Dog in the street menacing 
- Dog pursuit
- Cornered, cat appears
- Cat attacks tail
- Dog and Cat attack, Tiefling Shadow above
- Tiefling drops on me, is undead
- Tiefling grabs me and tells me ow him/stole from him/ 
- It’s my brother
- I don't understand why, I am myself undead, by body progressively changing and dying. I haven't even realized when or how. But his hands, their burn through my skin, through my flesh
- He tears one my horn from my skull, the better part of my arm (left of course) is torn to shreds
- I am trying to break free but I can't, his hold is immuable, the unmovable rigor mortis 

- his next assault is directed at my fangs, he's already pulled two of them. My flesh and my blood spread all over the alley, on the wall, ob the ground. And the smell, incinerated flesh, and still not a flame, except for the black veils dancing in my brother’s eyes. his relentless savagery is going to destroy me, I know it. I am already dead, but I can't let anyone destroy me 

- I destroy it and everything he was, I’ll never see him again, and I failed myself by destroying instead of creating
- I am now wandering endlessly, through the steps, above the clouds of frozen mountains, shuffling the sands at the bottom of each of the seven (? How many here? 9, like the hells?) seas. My half dismembered body carrying me further, never regenerating, never resting, eternally wandering the plane, searching and waiting, not knowing what, this endless pain, that endless misery and sadness. My brother had never been like that, he's always been kind and weak, never in his entire life, except on that single and unique occasion, the day he Tore our sister to pieces
