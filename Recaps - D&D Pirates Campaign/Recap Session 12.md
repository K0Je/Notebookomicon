## Entry: Back at the Rising Sun, The Mage Tower

Ah, the Rising Sun—city of splinters and guilds, of gold-choked merchants and half-talented hedge wizards with delusions of grandeur. Our ship barely touched the harbor stones before the crew scattered like startled gulls. I, however, had loftier aspirations than wine, wenches, or back-alley brawls. Trebor, the ever-blushing book-lizard, and Horineth—gods bless that walking barrel of cheap brandy and questionable parenting—chose to accompany me. An odd trio, I’ll admit. But even stars need sky, and shadows need contrast. The Mage Guild. One of seven thrones of influence in this sunburned jewel of a city. Naturally, the only one worth entertaining. We approached the Mage Tower—a spire of self-importance jutting into the skyline, practically screaming “we’re very clever and important, please acknowledge us.” Inside? As expected. A starry ceiling, illusory constellations, shelves teetering with tomes, magical whatnots humming in the air... delightful, in a theatrical sort of way.

Our reception committee: Olórin Mithandrir, whose beard had more experience than half the room combined, and Neraxa, a woman carved from equal parts sharp wit and cold suspicion. She watched me with the intensity of someone who suspects they’ve seen your face in a prophecy about the end of the world. She might not be wrong. They dubbed us “adepts”. We were told of two trials required for entrance. No details. Just smiles, vague words, and an unspoken challenge in Neraxa’s eyes. Oh yes, she wants to see me break. She’ll be disappointed. Trebor was already wringing his hands, eyes sparkling like a child let loose in a library. Sweet boy. Brilliant, in that head-stuck-in-a-scroll way. He asked questions. Polite ones. He even bowed. I half-expected him to hand them a resumé. He’s awkward, twitchy, and overprepared—but his mind is sharp. Like a scalpel. Or a cracked mirror. We'll see. Horineth... gods. He burped somewhere between “greetings” and “guild,” and leaned against a chair that groaned under the weight of several bad life choices. He smells like wet bark and regret. And yet, there’s something... steady in him. He’s survived. Bred, even. Allegedly. You don’t get that far in life without a stubborn sort of wisdom. Or just being too drunk to die.

## Entry: Trial One – The Book That Breathed

They threw us into a charming little nightmare: a village on the brink, suffocating under a tide of black tendrils—alive, hungry, wrong. Classic wizardry: “face the darkness within,” or whatever nonsense Olórin whispers to his beard. Trebor, ever the scholar, dove into his magic cube, unraveling it like a thesis. The poor lizard looked ready to combust from nerves, but I must admit—he knew what he was doing. Which left Horineth and me to keep the creeping void at bay. I didn’t hesitate. Void Rend pulsed, eager. I reached into the void and commanded the darkness to back down. And it did. Slowly, reluctantly. Even shadows know when they are outmatched. Hori, wheezing, sparkling cast fairy fire that lit up the tendrils like a tavern stage. Ridiculous, but helpful. When the darkness surged again, I answered with my own astral tendrils. They clashed in the sky, and mine won. The void remembers its own.Hori unleashed his magic anti darkness bees and for a moment, the town glowed. Trebor, now in full flow, whispered his final incantation. And then it happened: A massive, radiant dome of protective magic burst outward from the cube, slamming down like a holy tide. It enveloped the village entirely. The tendrils shrieked—yes, shrieked—and vanished like smoke in the wind. It was teamwork, technically. But let’s be honest: I carried the void on my back and made it kneel.

## Entry: Trial Two – The Book That Breathed

No sooner had the light faded from our first victory than the second trial took hold—no rest for those who walk with greatness, I suppose. We found ourselves in a dark alchemy lab, the kind only mad scholars and dead men leave behind. Shadows writhed at the edge of vision, and at the center of the room lay a massive, veiny spellbook—alive in the worst 

way. Beside it, a dying elf adept, skin blackened with tendril-like veins. Death clung to him like a second skin. I investigated, of course. The others hesitated, but I’ve never feared the grotesque. From his grip, I retrieved a heavy skull-shaped key, still humming with residual necromancy. Lovely craftsmanship, really. The book was clearly cursed—possibly sentient—and we were expected to close it. Trebor, clever boy, tried to tilt the book with water and ice magic, freezing its pulsing edges. Horineth anchored it from the other side with brute force and what I generously call “nature magic.” The man has a talent for resisting death, even if he's always flirting with it. I, naturally, had the pleasure of facing the book’s mental assault. Its pages whispered promises and truths—delicious, forbidden truths. The kind I live for. It wanted me. I nearly wanted it back. But I held firm, forced the key into the lock, and with a satisfying, echoing click, the thing shut. We couldn’t read its secrets—not yet. But oh, how I wanted that book. If it weren’t for the glaring eyes of the Guild… well. Returned to the trial hall, we were rewarded. An amulet, crystalline and gleaming, humming with arcane potential. Enhances knowledge, they said—arcana and history. But I could feel it: this was only the beginning.

## Entry: Of Dinosaurs, Cat-Ladies, and Questionably Timed Heroics

We’d barely returned from Trial Two when Neraxa—ever the mistress of dramatic timing—ripped open a portal and informed us our companions were in danger. Of course they were. That’s what happens when I’m not supervising. I questioned her motives, naturally. She didn’t flinch. Trebor, bless his impulsive scales, tumbled in like a startled librarian. I followed, obviously. Horineth lingered—whispered with her, actually. Suspicious. He claims it was “just talk.” I’ll believe that when the stars go quiet. We emerged on a boulder overlooking a lush valley and a massive waterfall. Trebor lay on his ass—classic. In the clearing below, our party was unconscious, strewn like broken chess pieces. All except Bliss Halwinter, that stubborn paladin, who was still dueling a colossal T-Rex like she’d read too many 
heroic ballads. Naturally, I descended and mind-whipped the beast into confusion. Elegant. Precise. Then—BOOM. A meteor? A comet? No. Horineth, launched from the portal like a gods-damned cannonball, ripped through the dinosaur’s jaw mid-air like some drunk forest god of violence and poor decisions. I swear the thing choked on his belt buckle. The T-Rex spun, knocking over trees like toothpicks. Even I had to sidestep that one. Also present: Heidi, the eccentric cat-lady, and her saber-toothed companion Smilo. Yes, really. At one point, Smilo had taken a bite out of Horineth. And yet—Bliss healed the beast mid-fight. Saints weep. We killed the dinosaur—gloriously, messily, with maximum overkill. Bliss claimed she almost had it solo. Let her. She still was happy and grateful for our timely arrival.

Then came Heidi’s game: we had to return Smilo to his pack before she’d reopen the portal. She claimed she “couldn’t” do it now. A lie so thick even Trebor squinted. But fine. I played along. On the way, Horineth discovered a prehistoric bee the size of a goat. Of course he added one of their numbers to his growing hive in exchange for one of his most loyal bees. We reached Smilo’s family. His father, enormous and regal, was clearly two seconds from mauling us. Until Horineth—again, somehow—convinced him he was our 

leader. I laughed. Out loud. And yet... it worked. The beast gifted him a magical pelt. Of course he did.

With the favor done, Heidi reopened the portal and we returned to Faceless Haven.I still don’t trust her. Nor do I trust whatever Neraxa whispered into Hori’s ear. But for now, the party lives. The dinosaur dies. The bee buzzes. And I remain, as ever, the one holding it all together.

## Entry: The Stinking Rat, a Legend, and the Price of Fame

After our heroic escapades and prehistoric diplomacy, we sought the only thing more dangerous than magic: cheap ale and old friends. Enter: Jimbo’s Tavern, better known as The Stinking Rat. A place where dreams ferment, and so does the furniture. Horineth and Jimbo? Already halfway through a reunion bender before I ordered my first drink. Turns out they go way back—something about a gambling boat, a missing goat, and a misunderstanding involving three dwarves and a bad translation. I stopped asking. Trebor, bless his anxious soul, went searching for Simera—that lovely half-elf from Los Muertas. Word is, she’s dockside on La Casa Bonita. He lit up when he heard it. I expect a wedding invite eventually.

And me? I wore Lorenzo—charming, sharp, devastatingly wanted. That grin could ruin reputations. That coat? Custom tailored delusion. And then I found Idol Kidd—one of the Big Three. I approached. I told him:

“Hank the Tank. First mate. Monster. Dead.
But we gave him an honorable death, for his past with the Wet Flags.”

That was a lie. What really happened? We scattered his corpse across a canyon and let the birds finish the sermon. Heavy words, spoken deliberately. Kidd didn’t draw steel. He drew breath. He suspected already. Hanks daughter, Masa sobbed, but held back. He listened. Thanked us. That kind of man commands respect—because he knows when to set down the blade. We also told him about Tempest and Jelena, kidnapped by Hank.

And Horineth, half-soused, spoke of Relbellis—his son. A name on the kidnapper list… but only because he was protecting the children.

In return, Kidd shared intel:

• 3 Thingers now runs the brothel. Delightful.

• Krenko consolidated power over the artisan and trade guilds. Monopolist worm.

• The mine collapse? Already in my notes.

Then… the final touch.Wanted posters. One for Lorenzo. Handsome devil. I’m flattered. And one for Horineth—less flattering. He’s furious they slimmed him down. We toasted our notoriety. I winked at a barmaid. She asked if I was "the Lorenzo." I winked again. She blushed. They adore him. But soon... they’ll fear him.

## Entry: A Virgin, a Paladin, and a Sky Full of Secrets

I wasn’t there. Not physically. But I know what happened. Bliss Halwinter, battle-born noble with a love for strategy and feline figurines, accepted a date. Urza, scholar, arcane virgin, and former attempted beefcake, invited her to his three-story glass-crowned penthouse. 

Naturally. That’s what you do when you’re trying to impress a half-elf paladin with daddy issues and a love of tactical maneuvers. The doors opened automatically. A scent of lavender guided her like a spell. Of course it did. The man has researched her. Extensively. Alarmingly. Dinner was tailored to her childhood favorites—meaning either Urza is agenius of culinary divination or he bribed her family’s kitchen staff. And there were cat statues everywhere. Too many. Cute until they start to feel like they’re watching. Which, of course, they were. They played darts. The tension loosened. And then came the drug. A mind-cinema spell, delivered from matching hammocks, because what screams romance like shared hallucinations?

What followed was... fascinating:

1. Bahamut vs. Tiamat. Celestial siblings tearing the heavens asunder. Bliss was enthralled by the tactics. Urza dropped facts like a nervous historian on speed. Apparently, Bahamut has a human form named Ximor. That’ll be useful—or dangerous—later.

2. Blackbeard’s War. A legend drenched in myth... facing defeat. But what stole the scene? A young Crazy Frog—yes, the one—killing three officers like it was nothing. Bliss was stunned. So was I, secondhand.

3. Roger Morgan in Admiral’s Regalia. Notorious pirate. Wears a marine uniform. I don’t know if that’s betrayal or deep cover, but either way—it's knowledge that could break kingdoms. 

Afterward, Bliss—head still swimming—asked how Urza knew all this.He claimed the spell went wild. Said it was conjured “at random.” Please. Nothing in magic is random when you want it badly enough. They stargazed. She kissed his cheek. He will write an epic about it in his head for the next decade. And maybe... just maybe... she’ll remember him a little differently now.

## Entry: Bulls, Babies, and Something That Shouldn’t Be

While I was busy learning forbidden lore and dodging my own face on wanted posters, Horineth decided to take a pastoral detour. He visited Goliath—his prized breeding bull, because of course he owns one. The bull lives on the Rusticus farm, up north of Rising Sun. A wholesome place, supposedly. Chickens, fences, family secrets. All that. He brought Goliath a new cow, a striking purple beauty named Milka. No, not a metaphor. She is, quite literally, purple. It's apparently intentional. There, he was met by the ever-hospitable Horst and Minerva Rusticus, who promptly hit him with the news: Goliath had broken his leg—breeding too aggressively on other farms. (I have nothing to add to that sentence. It stands in its own... glory.)

Naturally, they had to renovate the pasture. 5,000 gold. Horineth nearly collapsed. Until—plot twist—they made 5,500 gold in stud fees. So, in typical Hori fashion, he panic-sweated through a crisis that didn’t exist.

Then it got weird. Goliath was happy to see him. (The bull. Not a metaphor again.) Then Mandolin—the Rusticus daughter—entered the scene. Apparently, Hori and Mandolin had a one-night stand at some point. Hori forgot. Mandolin did not. She’s three months pregnant—but looks seven. Hori touched her belly, and the child inside moved with impossible strength. Not like a kick. Like a warning. And then, as he tells it, time froze. Mandolin’s eyes shifted. Her voice changed. She said the child would be a “spawn.” That it was coming soon. She’s not just a farm girl. Something is inside her, Hori doesn’t remember it clearly. His mind fogged, like a dream half-remembered after too much mead and one psionic concussion. Then everything returned to normal. Horst was already talking about marriage. Minerva offered him extra stew. Goliath mooed. Horineth said goodbye. But I don’t think he left. Not all of him.

While I was recovering from whatever Horineth unleashed in the countryside, Trebor was making his boldest move yet—approaching Simera, the charmingly brilliant half-elf of Señoras Muertas. To do that, he first had to get past Mary “Red Beard” Read, the first mate of Ann Bonny. Mary didn’t stop him. She let him through because she wanted to watch him fail. Fair. But before he could reach Simera, he was intercepted by the Queen of Fire and Knives herself: Captain Ann Bonny. You see, Idol Kidd—the living legend and aspiring balladeer of heartbreak—had told Trebor to talk him up to Ann. Subtle matchmaking. It went exactly how you’d expect when a nervous, kind-hearted dragonborn tries to casually suggest that a drunk old flame is worth her time. She almost choked him to death. With magic. I’m told his feet left the ground. Briefly.

Then Kidd showed up—hammered, heartbroken, and absolutely convinced that a love song would win her over. He sang. She blinked. He left. Crushed. Finally, the air cleared. The tension dropped. Ann stormed off, and Simera arrived—smiling, happy to see him.

She hugged him. Trebor nearly exploded. They walked the docks, quietly, awkwardly, sweetly. Then—of course—Horineth appeared in the background: Drunk. Naked. Running from city guards. As one does. Trebor, still talking to Simera, casually froze a puddle to trip the guards and buy Hori some time. Smooth. Noble. Completely ridiculous. He went right back to his conversation. No big deal. Just an intercontinental savior with excellent manners.

Then... he sang to her. A real song. A love song. Awkward. Adorable. She loved it.

She kissed him. Not a grand, sweeping kiss. No, it was awkward—hesitant—just enough to make Trebor freeze in place like he’d been turned to stone. He blinked four times. She smiled. He stammered something about “next time being more bad boy.”

She told him she’s into bad boys. He told her their next date would be dangerously bad. 

She smiled. They parted. And Trebor—shaky, starry-eyed, and very possibly in love—

survived. Barely.

## Entry: Of Cookie Scouts, Stabbed Siblings, and a Goat Named Bliss

Trebor and Horineth decided they wanted to join the Thieves’ Guild. Why? Unclear. Possibly a mid-life crisis. Possibly a deep desire to disappoint their mothers. Bliss and I accompanied them—not to join (gods, no), but to assist. Mostly for the story. The first challenge? Find the guild’s entrance. We were told to look for a pink warehouse near the lightning tower. Subtle, really. Bliss and I heard voices through the floorboards. Naturally, I took her javelin and stabbed the wooden ground. Hit something soft. Turned out to be Relbellis’s shoulder—yes, Horineth’s thieves-guild-master son.

Found him.

At the same time, Horineth, unaware of all this, found a separate hidden entrance, snuck in, and somehow snuck up behind his own son, who had just opened a trapdoor to yell at us for stabbing him. Trebor, of course, was just standing there, watching the entire circus unfold like a man trying to survive a fever dream.

### The Job

Their test? Steal a magical elven book from a noble’s manor uptown. Plans were made. Bad ones. Chaotic ones.

• I would distract the front guards.

• Hori would use spider climb to sneak in with Trebor, who had some clever smoke magic.

• Bliss would act as lookout, using goat sounds for “all clear,” and peacock cries for danger. She committed fully. Too fully. 

### The Execution

I transformed into a sweet little scout girl selling cookies. Braids. Sash. Smile. It worked. Too well. One of the guards was a degenerate, and tried to lure me into the woods. So, I went with him. Then murdered him. In a cabin. Very messily. Meanwhile, Hori and Trebor used a dino steak to distract the guard dog. Not elegant, but effective. They crept inside. Drugged the cleaning lady. Knocked her out cold. Hori probably kissed her forehead. They raided the cellar, stole expensive wine, and—of course—Trebor, a dry alcoholic, had a moment. He pulled through, though. They got the book. They also triggered multiple alarms, killed three guards, and left enough evidence to fill a courtroom. When they got back to the guild, Relbellis told them, very politely, that they would probably have to try again. Meanwhile, Bliss was still making goat noises on the rooftop for three more hours, unaware the mission was long over. No one had the heart to tell her.

### Conclusion?

• Book: stolen

• Bodies: three

• Cleaning staff: chemically unconscious

• Guard dog: full of dino steak

• Goat noises: haunting the night

We are, without question, the worst best thieves this city has ever seen.
