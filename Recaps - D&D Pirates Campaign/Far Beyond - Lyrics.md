Far beyond where tempests blow,
Am
where nameless sails still come and go
F
we found a place, no crown, no chain—
G
just wind and tide and salt and flame
C
No king commands these waters deep,
Am
just secrets every sailor keeps
F
but those who honor what they've done
G
find peace beneath the Rising Sun
 
[Chorus]
C
Ohhh, home in the Rising Sun,
Am
where pirate hearts can rest as one
F
we drink to life, to storm and sea
G
to those who died for liberty
C
Ohhh, home in the Rising Sun,
Am
from ash to fire, the dream begun
F
our flag is free, our souls are wild
G
no tyrant tames the ocean's child
 
[Verse 2]
C
Old Crazy spoke with fire and steel
Am
his pain was deep, his vow was real
F
and Eleanor with clever grace
G
brought justice to this lawless place
C
From shadow rose the guilds we trust
Am
from broken gold, a bond robust
F
and those who step into this bay
G
can rest their blades and debts repay
 
[Chorus repeat]
 
[Bridge]
Am
One last drink for Blackbeard’s ghost
F
a cheer for all we miss the most
C
a song for sins and tales we spin
G
and battles we still carry in
 
[Chorus]
C
Ohhh, home in the Rising Sun,
Am
where pirate hearts can rest as one
F
we drink to life, to storm and sea
G
to those who died for liberty
C
Ohhh, home in the Rising Sun,
Am
from ash to fire, the dream begun
F
our flag is free, our souls are wild
G
no tyrant tames the ocean's child
 
[Outro]
C
Home in the Rising Sun...
Am
where legends come undone
F
we sail, we live, we fight, we run—
G
but always to the Rising Sun.
