Lupin Flower Village, sometime way past morning.

Alzun and Akta, having previously spent an arduous sleepless night hiking against a cursed adversity to even get there, wake up the same as various other Orphans of the Seas, namely Jesse, Korrin, Bliss and Horineth, with some difficult recollections of the nature and events of the night they just spent. Reuniting after what just happened, indeed led to some unhinged partying and abuse of various substances (as well as abuse of furniture. and maybe more than just furniture…). 


Taking the luxury to set up a brunch, down a beer, or a schoggimilch, get more drugs, run some pharmaceutical errands for dead people, walking around naked, chitchat some with notorious local dwarfs, indulge into shameless looting as well as  meet some old acquaintance (the likes of recovering Rossmarus or Karen), the scattered orphans finally manage to meet up, attracted to each other by their curiosity about the noise and  the agitation at the tavern.


The villagers are preparing themselves to defend the village at all cost. The ritual for cancelling Ragnarok must take place tonight and they're set on countering the expected attempt, by Byrion, to prevent the conduction of the snooze ritual.

Clad in pure snow white robes, voluntary villagers are displaying their willingness to do what needs to be done in order to prevent the world from ending. (no worries though, just the current plane of existence. But still, this was checked with the people in the know: no one can sit this one out. if the world ends, everyone's getting it and no bunker's gonna help... )

  

The seer of the village, clad in black robes (right? not everyone has to be a sacrificial offering for the ritual apparently. Because yes the white robes indicate that the wearer is on the waiting list to serve as a sacrifice, which is a requirement for the ritual). Anyways. The seer informes the group that Ragnarok isn't prevented for the first time (noticed the foreshadowing? or spoiler, I'll let you decide). Indeed, these people have already done it successfully! Every 10 years. Thing is, there was a king around last time. And usually, that's the king who chooses the sacrificial victims. So right now the only people available to take such an important decision are... the worthy orphans! 

We'll skip the details about all the ethics and moral stuff that's been discussed there and then, but suffice to say that the decision wasn't an easy one to take. In the end, Sleepy, Doc, Daupy, Helpy and Schneeflitchen were blessed with the honor of becoming instrumental in ending the end of the world. Which was announced to them by the 5 choosing orphans, and which was received with varying degrees of disappointment, shame, sadness (as well as a varying degree of understanding of the meaning and scope of the annonce itself). 

  

The BAKHA! (Bliss, Akta, Korrin, Horineth and Alzun) choose well, as the gods confirmed (said the Seer at least). And therefore too, they did not only give answers, but they received one, though perhaps somewhat cryptic, to a burning question the seer allowed each of the BAKHAs to ask. 

Topics of interest were Thassa’s health, Alzun’s father, knowledge of the arcanes and ways around the multiverse as well as purpose in life. The answers, the writer will let you decipher for yourselves. 

That riddler of a seer didn't stop there. As if the mystery around the answers given by the blind augur weren't enough, he also read the fate of his temporary hosts in the cards they drew (imagine a kind of tarot, but even cooler). 

What isn't known yet to our protagonists, is that this little experiment has some aspects of what's known as a self fulfilling prophecy. Indeed, meddling with the future is never without consequences. Banes and Boons were bestowed upon the unknowing characters. Gravitationally Unbound, Unseen Pursuer, Child of Darkness, Gemini’s Gift and Champion's Chorus. These were the intelligible parts of the omens. The ones among the three cards each had in their hands, which resonated with the highest intensity with the person. Their workings and reach of these on the (sometimes) merry band of orphans remains to be seen and understood.

But what is sure, as Sir Seer himself warned about, is that these omens will have an impact on each person and will influence their path greatly! 

  

Morally troubled by the decision they made and the responsibility they now hold for the future (or lack thereof in this particular case) of the 5 voluntary sacrificial offerings, the BAKHAs have no choice but to announce the dire news to the people directly concerned and then rest a bit before proceeding with the ritual (you can't hurry these kind of things, the ritual has to happen much later that day). 

  

Gathered around the Eternal Forge, everyone gets busy with following the instructions given by the master of ceremony (MC Seer, for short). This includes getting rid of these awesome pieces of magical relics gathered from all over Faceless Haven. Darn… you think you're finally out of the woods thanks to that +3 equipment you looted for free (blood shed in battle not taken into account)? Well think again! Ragnarok won't be stopped by throwing commoners’ spoons and rags in the forge, no no no. 

Heartbroken, the orphans throw the items one after the other in the forge (the chosen lucky nr.5 of dwarves and their matron cooperated without issue and bravely threw themselves in the eternal flames of the sacred forge, but our heroes have other things on their mind at the moment. like their lost badass loot). Curiously enough, some infernal iron chunks of metal are expelled from the forge as the items are thrown in (like what's left after recycling enough aluminum cans I guess?). 

  

Fog, Mist and a rumble could have been witnessed by the sentry, hadn't she been speared to death on the spot (Throat shot, no pun intended). So it's the rocks falling on them which alert the ritualists of the arrival of Muradin, harboring glowing blue eyes, same as his troops. He's here on Byrion’s orders to stop the ritual, by force of need be. He brought back up of course, including several catapults.

Ensues an Initiative roll and some generous, mutually murderous, whacking from all parts as Muradin, perched on a gigantic mechanical contraption made for war (could look like a giant armored tank on the reader's plane) goes for the fortifications of Lupin Flowers Village, breaking through them and destroying Kanibis’ ‘green’-house in the process (Milka saved herself, everyone, calm down. now.). 

All the while, everyone is fighting for their lives (with more or less success) as the blue eyed foot soldiers spawn from every corner of the settlement to wreak havoc and desolation. Protection of MC seer as well as the vigorous shoving of more valuable items into the forge, in order to continue with the ritual, is handled by Jesse and Alzun, who's still weakened from his recent prowess and subsequent injuries. 

  

During the fight, Muradin came to his senses, albeit briefly, and let out a curse intended at Byrion. It seems indeed as if Muradin was trying to prevent Ragnarok, but was now under the influence of Byrion instead. Hence forced to do the biddings of his hidden puppeteer in a trance-like state. That aspect went, purposefully or not, ignored and Muradin succumbed to an overkill fatality by a very riled up and furry Alzun. With his last breath, he asked his killers to save King Arthas and to save Faceless Haven. 

The foot soldiers, now that the control over their mind got dispelled by Muradin’s passing, realized the murders and other atrocities they just committed. They then proceeded to take the only way out they were left with, and committed a coordinated mass-seppuku. Let me tell you what, this must have been spectacular! 

  

Not to be ignored either is the fact that the eternal forge is now no more eternal than a candle in a brothel. The tank rammed it and destroyed the whole construct. I guess they now have 10 years to figure that one out. Good luck Faceless people. 

  

Despite being shocked by the savagery demonstrated by the dragonborn, Jesse sees that Alzun saved the day. (I haven't mentioned it yet but they managed to throw enough relics into the fire when Alzun, in an ultimate last ditch effort, sacrificed his own ancestral weapon! Stabbing the flames and plugging his precious link with his family into certain destruction).

  

Upon successful rescheduling of the apocalypse,  but not before some casual looting of the dead, realizing that Kheltuzad's magic was at work, botching an interrogation, a selective buria, l and some complaining, the team went on and Horineth took upon himself to make things right for the survivors. Well, at least for Milka (who’ll get to meet Goliath. Wink wink) and Kanibis, offering them the means to tend to their broken hope and resolve. He also somehow managed to remember to grab the chunks of infernal iron, which everyone else forgot in their respective bickering, moping and/or looting.

Also, someone's gotten an extra, courtesy of the rightfully prouded gods and of an efficiently persuaded mysterious and cryptic seer (again, MC seer for short). A living skeleton cat is now hanging around the horns of one very happy Tiefling. 

  

The priest, keeping his priorities straight, lets the saviors of the village (and of the world, not to mention) take the long rest they desperately needed, and also deserved, but urges them nevertheless to press on and reach the Pinnacle of Darkness. Under that mountain is where Kheltuzad, the Lich King, and his undeads await in the shadows. 

  

This whole time, Jeyna dedicated herself to freeing a passage through the freezing eternal ice, leading to Kheltuzad's lair. 24 hours of hard work paid off and the entrance is presently accessible. After gifting the team a 5-pack of homebrewed ice-damage-preventing-vials, they part. Jayna remains at the entrance, to ensure it stays open, while the fearless team of mixed races pirates advance along a seemingly infinitely long staircase, leading them some 5’000 steps deep underground.

Watch out! The stairs stop there and a slide-like section begins! Too late… Horineth already slided down that part and thereafter, served as crash pad for his following fearless (irresponsible?) companions.

  

The room they find themselves in is shaped like a star, 1 of it's five branches being closed off by a door, freezing to the touch (tested and approved as a damage-inducing piece of furniture by Horineth). 

Wind, Death, Hope, Anger and Calm are the words Korrin could make out of the scriptures on the closed door. 

  

Following their instincts, the group goes through the arm of the star named “Hope”. Upbeat music welcomed them and then, the room they arrived in, locked itself with ice walls, trapping them. Which is surprising because everyone always checks for traps when going into another room.

  

A dark crystal floats at the center of the room, a mirror appears on one the wall, soon followed by 4 others in the vicinity of the first one. 

Horineth, then Alzun and then Korrin, all get to understand that these aren't quite your usual 0815 type of mirrors. The mirror hits back when hit, and shows to each of them troubling visions of themselves. They can see themselves obtaining ,in part, what their heart desires for it to be taken away from them, showing them events they dread! Akta and Bliss experience the same behavior from yet another mirror.

The task force Orphans of the Seas doesn't have time to debrief their visions as a voice booms into the room, taking a stab at the feelings and subconscious of each of them. 

Horineth’s role and capacity as a parent are being put on trial, Korrin is straight up called a thief (who'd have guessed, right?), Akta's honesty is accused of falsehood, Bliss’s motivation and very own identity are under attack while Alzun’s purpose and future are likewise thrown in front of a moving train.

  

What is happening isn't quite clear to them, much less what was meant by the voice. Ensues a long, deep, intense and emotionally loaded chain of discussions about untold aspects of the past and of the personality of the five stars of the day. 

  

These being private and very very packed with tons of lore and content, the editor elected to publish them as a DLC, if at all. As freebies, just know, dear reader, that Derrek, his Shadowfell excursion and his family business were a particularly spicy slice of the discussions since the title of “Dark Emperor” was mentioned! Not only that but the title was then (and now for the crunchy part), connected to Kerret himself! The murderer of Alzun's father, and the revelation about him being known as The Dark Emperor, sparked some extremely inspired theory crafting from the conferencing companions (but we won't spread rumors here, we're strictly reporting facts).

  

Facing again their predicament, the 5 brave saviors of Lupin Flowers Village arrived to the consensus, although not unanimous, that the room was testing their conscience, their guilt and remorses. How much denial was still being held on to by the accused, proportionally induced physical damages in them as the mirrors shattered. The psychotherapeutic session had come to an end and left some participants in shambles. 

Deciding to not stay in the room forever, Korrin went for it and touched the dark crystal (No Skeksis were armed in the making of that scene). What followed happened in the dreamscape. 

  

The story of a very young, abandoned and rejected girl is being reenacted by the members of the orphans. Up to the attack on the village by brutal soldiers looking for the girl with the cold blood. The villagers having been swiftly dispatched and the little girl taken prisoner, the entranced Orphans shift back into their own reality. 

  

After reaching the central room again, they decided to explore the arm of the star depicted as “Wind”. And that was maybe kind of an understatement because what they reached was a very large cavern, where another dark crystal was floating at the top of a central mound, surrounded by a serious snowstorm.

Desperate and clumsy attempts to reach the submit were made, which came very close to killing, or at least very badly injure, the characters. Amidst the uncoordinated efforts to advance against the strong gales or efforts to try to save each other, another, masterful, attempt at reaching the summit was crowned with success. Horineth touching the crystal triggered another dreamscape incursion.

  

This time around, it's the story of a young girl, found alone on a frozen pass, (alive! What a miracle!) and brought back to a village, which the travelers of the past are participating in. The little girl endures rejection but is finally adopted by the couple who found her. This respite wouldn't last long though, as strange events followed within the year. And as villagers do when enough inexplicable deaths occur, they get their favorite witch-hunting pitch and forks off the wall and try to kill the person they blame for their misery. Even her adoptive brother (Esu 2) died, drowned under the ice sheet of the local pond. But the little girl is nevertheless saved by her adoptive father, who dies at the hands of the angry mob while trying to stall them, and by her adoptive mother who runs with her in the blinding snowstorm, trying to escape the savagery of the villagers.
