![Ophidia - v.1.1](src-umbroscriptorium/Ophidia%20-%20v.1.1.jpg)

A legendary whip wielded by Erebus, father to our clan, 10 generations ago.  

The identity of the creator of our ancestral weapon is unfortunately long-lost to us, the circumstances of its forging are likewise unknown. 
 
## Description:

*The mystical whip named "Ophidia, The Arm of Erebus."* 

To the unlearned, it's a typical bullwhip with a 17.6cm handle, a length of 176cm from handle to thong finished by a surprisingly thin 65.5cm fall and cracker. 

The whip features a serpentine design, made of obsidian-black scaled leather. Intricate runes are engraved along the thong of the whip, showing a deep purple coloration and seemingly randomly positioned. Some of these runes, if taken separately and repositioned, would form a caduceus. Pure white vertebrae break the continuity of the black thong at irregular intervals. This added relief and contrast gives a spine-like air to the whip.

The whip's cracker displays 3 sharp fangs, each held by an Electrum bezel.

The handle is crafted from twisted and melted golden and silvery electrum, which wraps around a straight, even though knotted, Duskwood pentagonal core piece. The Electrum covering the handle gives the impression that molten metal ran over it and solidified around the Duskwood core which it tried to engulf, as the patterns of the coating seem perfectly random. The uncoated parts of the handle showcase an iridescent vein of purple chalcedony running through the core. Silver sigils and runes adorn the handle in various places. 

As an homage to our proud bloodline, the end of the handle culminates in a small humanoid skull with short horns. The skull is gilded with runic motives formed by the golden electrum metal securing it to the handle. Within its screaming fanged mouth, working as a prong setting, protrudes a gemstone. Over the ages, the crystal lodged in the pommel has been known to be replaced by another, of different properties, by the previous owners of Ophidia. Currently, Ophidia adorns a splendid black onyx stone, cut by expert lapidarists. Of the previous gemstone, the whereabouts are unknown to us. By holding The Arm of Erebus the brave wielder of our Ancestral Weapon can henceforth evoke The Wand of Orcus and display their allegiance to our demonic legacy and to our bloodline.

  

## Technical Notes:

### **Attunement:**
This ancestral weapon requires attunement and will only let itself be attuned to, and wielded by, someone sharing the bloodline of the original owner of the weapon.

The attunement's process and duration are specific to each owner. The attunement may be the same between two owners or it may be different. Tests and challenges may for example be required. 

The weapon is inhabited by the spirits of the ancestors of the wielder. They decide if the weapon is granted further and additional improvements or if the weapon is deactivated.

The ancestors are made happy or angry by the actions of the wielder. Angering the spirits of the ancestors may lead to the weapon's deactivation, which then becomes a mundane version of the weapon. In such cases, pleasing the spirits of the ancestors is the only way to convince them to allow a renewed attunement and hence, a return of the weapon's abilities.

- Notes about Hidden:  
    - Does only camouflage as a chest harness on the body of the wielder. The weapon likes to stay with the owner and feel the body heat in this way. Usually  doesn’t accept to camouflage into another form, and in the event it accepts to be anything else than coiled around the body of the owner, it’ll never let the wielder release the object from its grip (if camouflaged, never accepts to leave the owner even if willed by the owner itself). Under duress, the weapon will revert to its ancestral weapon original appearance of a whip on separation from the owner). 
    
	- You can use an action to speak this weapon’s command word, the weapon appears as a different item of a similar size until you speak the command word again to end this effect. The weapon retains all abilities during this time, and if a creature uses its action to examine the item, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.
