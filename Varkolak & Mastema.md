# Varkolak, Clannish Totem

![Varkolak V2 - artbreeder](src-umbroscriptorium/Varkolak%20V2%20-%20artbreeder.jpeg)

Akta's left forearm is always adorned with an intricately designed gauntlet known as "Varkolak." 

This multi-layered piece combines long, thin, dark leather laces, resembling bandages, with arrays of interwoven small bones, sharp fangs, teeth, and shards of horns. 

A single iridescent blue crystal is firmly positioned among these elements along the leather.

The open-ended design wraps around her wrist and thumb, spiraling up her lower arm, and is held securely in place with clever knots.


# Mastema, Stones of the Eons

Akta is able to approximate the passing of time thanks to the witherite stone set on her gauntlet. 

It is only appropriate for Akta to carry Mastema on Varkolak as together they are both parts of her brother, one gifted by a living, one stolen from a corpse. This cycle of life symbolically reminding her to ponder and meditate with the ones she carries with her in this way. Her brother, her sister, and all the others from her family and from her clan.

NB: Bracelet should instead be 3 stones of chalcedony. 1 for time/movement, 1 for light, 1 for temperature. 

The stone, which she named Mastema, was enchanted by her brother, long ago, to imbue it with the property of changing its tint and hues according to the changes in the light and temperature in the environment.

The hues taken by the stone are within the range of the hues glaciers would showcase when exposed to naturally occurring light. The enchantment is the source of these colors, atypical for Whiterite.

As the stone’s transparency and color slowly shift according to environmental conditions, it informs the wearer on the passing of time. The relative time is inferred from how close or how far the stone is to known reference states, namely the Zenith and the Nadir. This property allows the user, who must be thoroughly used and attuned to the stone, to infer how many portions of the day have already passed, and hence, knowing the length of a standard day cycle, the corresponding relative time of the day. For example, it is possible to know, assuming a 24h day, that if the stone is midway through its spectrum leading from Nadir to Zenith, then the relative time should be approximately 6:00 AM.

Since the stone is capable of adapting to any environment, it obviously also needs to get used to any new environment it is exposed to. This attunement usually takes about a full day cycle. Attuning the stone to an environment is only necessary and relevant if the length of a day cycle or if the environmental conditions, such as temperature range and strength of natural light, are significantly changing within a short period of time. Teleportation to a distance destination or change of Plane are typical examples of changes requiring a renewed attunement. Slowly changing conditions, such as the cycle of seasons or standard traveling over long distances, are usually not an issue as the stone also slowly adapts itself to said changes in its environment.

The stone will react to the uncertainty by rapidly shifting through its hues. Once the stone is attunement, the shifts in color will noticeably slow down from the maelstrom-like shiftings of uncertainty.   

The longer the stone remains exposed to regular day-night cycles in a given environment, the more precise the shifts in its coloration will become. 

The key to an efficient attunement of the stone to its environment is regularity. Regular day-night cycles are required for an effective attunement, no matter how extreme the changes are during the cycle. The more regular the cycle, the more efficient is the attunement, which is noticeable through an improved attunement time.

Fast travel as well as dramatically and rapidly changing climatic conditions can slow down the attunement process. 

Prolonged stay in artificially darkened or enlightened places (such as underground caves or powerfully illuminated closed rooms) may shift the stone out of attunement. 

So may also do a prolonged stay in places excessively cold or warm, compared to the rest of the environment, (e.g. being thrown into a fire or trapped in ice for a long enough period of time).

Usually, sufficient natural light (i.e. sunlight, be it direct or reflected, for example by the moon or other naturally occurring light reflecting objects) is sufficient to maintain the stone in alignment for a prolonged duration, but not forever if adverse effects or influences are at play.  
  

# Gameplay quirk: 

Takes an extra short break every 6h40min after the last short/long rest in order to practice her daily maintenance ceremony.

That ceremony consists in casting a couple buffs, recasting an Animate Dead as appropriate if any of these companions are with me, recasting Gentle Repose where required, and Trapping a Spell in Ophidia.

All done holding Ophidia in her right hand, pressed against Volkalok, on her left bandaged upper arm, executing the somatic requirements with her left hand while chanting the incantations in a deeply guttural voice. If she doesn't, she starts getting nervous. Her restlessness grows noticeable because her tail starts lashing, increasingly often the more time passes, around her legs

→ (1-3) predefined “Folly” per char could add depth to the mechanic.  

## **Gameplay Quirk (harder/insanity level)  
She grows obsessive with her rituals and precision in their execution and regularity. Some or all of the following traits, show up and grow in intensity (also relative to the current insanity level) with time to reach levels showing the deep addiction (*have an addiction) Akta has for her powers over the dead and, in some measure and if applicable to the current build, over the living. The scale of growth in the moods is from “barely noticeable” to “dangerous to self and others”. 

She shows aggressiveness when inconvenienced, general irritability, lack of restrain, poorer sense of directions, tendency to react violently, relentlessness, tail waging, tries to push the events in order to favor the chance of her getting her ceremony fix, even it implies, at some stadium, to take seemingly irrational actions and/or it implies to endangering and/or harming allies unnecessarily in order to satisfy her crave for Arcane and Power. 

She finally feels she can’t live without practicing her rituals, by fear of losing her Undeads, hence wasting her energies gathering and maintaining them, fear of losing her perishable samples, fear of losing the buffs imbued to her through spell casting, fear of failing in her mission due to losing her resources. Akta can’t anymore and breaks mad, sinks into panic or falls catatonic.
